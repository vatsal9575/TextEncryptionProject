# TextEncryptionProject
By - Vatsal Panchal.


This is a project which encrypts the text message through some codes and provides it to you. The encrypted code can also be Decrypted through this application.
A project idea for some who is just a noob or Beginner.


This project can also be converted to .exe file by following these steps - 

pip install pyinstaller
pip install pandas
cd C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\TextEncryptionProject
Here, remane the main.py file to main.pyw. Then,
pyinstaller --onefile main.pyw
That's it. Your main.exe file would be ready in a folder named "dist".

Thank You.
